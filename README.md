## Music Formatter

Periodically extracts the Tabletop Audio mapping from the Google sheet linked in the
[Regal Goblins Toolbox](https://regalgoblins.com/toolbox.php), and parses it into a Gist
located [here](https://gist.github.com/DoctressWasTaken/7595154c578821f3234ac9b4464f7c1c).

Can be used in conjunction with this [macro](scripts/music-inserter.js) written for Foundry to generate
all playlists based on the files you have available in Foundry.

If you want to use your own file association instead you can generate and redirect the target of the script
accordingly.
